This is a project to develop networks out of gene,disease and snp data obtained from semantic queries executed on the database at Gene Wiki+.

Once a gene term is supplied, data from Gene Wiki Plus is retrieved and a Gene->Root_disease_term->SNP->Disease network is generated. For further convenience and utility, filter options are provided to enable the user to browse through the net at their own convenience. For further reference, export options into png,pdf,svg and txt are provided.

Data arranged in a tabular form is also shown for reference purposes for all four types of queries. These tables are generated by using Slick Grid(https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/), a javascript spreadsheet/table component.

We are currently getting data from gene wiki+ by employing JSONp and cross domain ajax requests. It is not a permanent but a very consistent method for now. I am employing a jQuery(http://jquery.com/), the popular javascript framework to retrieve data as well as to manipulate DOM elements.

The network is being generated by using CytoscapeWeb(http://cytoscapeweb.cytoscape.org/) which bring the power of Cytoscape to the Web. It is a flash object which can be manipulated via Javascript.
